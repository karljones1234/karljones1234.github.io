<h1>Chapter 4: The sun rises</h1>

<p>
Mark noticing that the monster could not see them, looking towards Jessica, who had her eyes closed the entire time.
</p>

<p>
Mark turning to face Jessica, his hands placed firmly on her shoulders, her eyes still shut tight, refusing to open them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't open your eyes Jessica, keep them shut" Mark said, trying to keep her alive, as well as himself, he had only thought
if she opened her eyes and saw the massive monster in front of them she would scream, the only outcome from that would both of them dying.
</p>


<p>
Mark slowly moving towards the monster, slowly bringing Jessica along with him. The only way the monster could see them was by sound, or smell,
this was the answer Mark had come to.
</p>

<p>
Mark and Jessica were inches from the monster, it was looking frantically to try and sniff them out, it was looking searching in the opposite direction, the perfect time to move.
</p>

<p>
Mark ripping a long piece from his shirt, wrapping it around Jessicas eyes to the back of her head, doing his best to avoid the worst case scenario.
</p>

<p>
"We can't take any chances Jessica, keep this on" Mark says as Jessica nods in agreement, she had no idea what was going on, and it was going to stay that way.
</p>

<p>
Mark frantically searches around the ground, his eyes constantly travelling throughout every section of the room they were in, there had to be something he could use to distract the monster.
</p>

<p>
"Stay here, I'll be back" Mark says looking over at Jessica, Mark who was in the middle of crawling slowly over to a small section of the large room.
</p>

<p>
Mark had hit the jackpot, he had found a lot of large objects, which could be used to attract the attention of the monster, at last some good news Mark had thought to himself.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Mark had picked up an object he heard a loud scream erupting from Jessica's location "Fuck" Mark shouted, running back to notice the monster hovering over Jessica, sniffing dangerously close to her as Jessica did her best to conceal her whimpering.
</p>

<p>
Mark doing the only thing he could think of, desperately banging the large object he had found against a wall, which sent a loud noise travelling throughout the entire room.
</p>

<p>
"Jessica! Get out of here! Come get me you freaks!" Mark shouted, running in the opposite direction of Jessica and the monsters, banging the object against the walls as he ran.
</p>

<p>
The monsters follow the noise, leaving Jessica by herself. Jessica stands up, walking towards the door, slowly opening it widely to feel the wind hit her body, the rain still falling hard and fast onto the ground outside.
</p>

<p>
Jessica looks back and where Mark had ran, tears forming in her eyes as she runs outside, the door closing behind her as she ran as fast as she could, running around the mansion to where they had entered, noticing the large tree that had blocked their original exit. Tears falling from her cheeks as her entire body is drenched in rain "I'm sorry!" Jessica cried as she got as far away from the mansion as possible
</p>

<p>
Mark who had exhausted all of his stamina, was trapped against a wall, his hands worn out from gripping onto the large object, his panting bretahing as the monster stared him in the face, letting out a loud screech in front of him, spit going all over Marks face.
</p>

<p>
As Mark closes his eyes the sun starts to rise, the clouds beginning to disperse, the rain coming to a complete stop.
</p>

<p>
"At least she survived.." Mark whispered to himself as the monster removed his head from his body, his lifeless body hitting the ground, the night was over and what a night it was.
</p>
