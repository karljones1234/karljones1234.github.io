Mark noticing that the monster could not see them, looking towards Jessica, who had her eyes closed the entire time
</p>

<p>
Mark turning to face Jessica, his hands placed firmly on her shoulders, her eyes still shut tight, refusing to open them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't open your eyes Jessica, keep them shut" Mark said, trying to keep her alive, as well as himself, he had only thought
if she opened her eyes and saw the massive monster in front of them she would scream, the only outcome from that would both of them dying.
</p>


<p>
Mark slowly moving towards the monster, slowly bringing Jessica along with him. The only way the monster could see them was by sound, or smell,
this was the answer Mark had come to.
</p>

<p>
Mark and Jessica were inches from the monster, it was looking frantically to try and sniff them out, it was looking searching in the opposite direction, the perfect time to move.
</p>

<p>
Mark ripping a long piece from his shirt, wrapping it around Jessicas eyes to the back of her head, doing his best to avoid the worst case scenario
</p>

<p>
"We can't take any chances Jessica, keep this on" Mark says as Jessica nods in agreement, she had no idea what was going on, and it was going to stay that way.
