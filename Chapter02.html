<h1>Chapter 2: A Horrifying Night</h1>

<p>
Mark and Jessica rush into the room that Sarah and John had entered, the screams growing louder as they got closer.
Jessica stopping at the doorway, frozen as if she was a statue, Mark standing next to her as they watched Sarah, sobbing and screaming knelt on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Mark slowly approaching Sarah as Jessica stays frozen in place, unable to move. Mark directly behind Sarah, looking over her shoulder to see the disemboweled John.
His entrails emptying out of his body as Sarah sobbed in front of him, a hole in his chest and his stomach sliced open.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to get Sick!" Mark shouted turning away, forcing Sarah to look away as well. Jessica slowly approaching Mark and Sarah, unaware of what was there.
</p>

<p>
Mark hadn't even noticed, Mark didn't even realize Jessica was walking towards John's mutilated body "Stay away Jessica!" Mark shouted, stopping Jessica in her tracks.
</p>

<p>
"There's no reason for you to see this!" Mark shouted walking towards Jessica.
