<h1>Chapter 2: A Horrifying Night</h1>

<p>
Mark and Jessica rush into the room that Sarah and John had entered, the screams growing louder as they got closer.
Jessica stopping at the doorway, frozen as if she was a statue, Mark standing next to her as they watched Sarah, sobbing and screaming knelt on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Mark slowly approaching Sarah as Jessica stays frozen in place, unable to move. Mark directly behind Sarah, looking over her shoulder to see the disemboweled John.
His entrails emptying out of his body as Sarah sobbed in front of him, a hole in his chest and his stomach sliced open.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to get Sick!" Mark shouted turning away, forcing Sarah to look away as well. Jessica slowly approaching Mark and Sarah, unaware of what was there.
</p>

<p>
Mark hadn't even noticed, Mark didn't even realize Jessica was walking towards John's mutilated body "Stay away Jessica!" Mark shouted, stopping Jessica in her tracks.
</p>

<p>
"There's no reason for you to see this!" Mark shouted walking towards Jessica, unaware of the ghoulish beast lurking on the ceiling, stalking it's prey,
drool dripping from the ceiling on top of John's mutilated corpse.
</p>

<p>
"AHHHHHH" Sarah screamed as she noticed the monster on all fours, like a wild animal, crushing Sarahs head with unrelenting force ceasing her screaming.
Mark's eyes widened as the monster began to stand up, almost like a freakishly large person. Mark was paralysed, paralysed at the sight of two of his friends, dead.
</p>

<p>
The monster, which was huge in size, walked towards the paralysed Mark and John, coming dangerously close to their bodies, until a loud thunder strike echoed through the mansion.
The monster flees, screeching as it jumps across the ceiling, into the shadows.
</p>

<p>
"We cant stay here!" Mark says grabbing hold of Jessica, walking towards the exit
</p>

<p>
"It wont open!" Mark shouts as he tries to open the door, unaware of the tree which had collapsed, landing directly on the doorstep, blocking their main exit.
