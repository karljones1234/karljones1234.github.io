<h1>Chapter 3: There will be Blood</h1>

<p>
Mark crouched down at the door, which had been blocked by a collapsed tree outside, shock and terror was finally starting to get through the cracks in Mark's armor.
Given up on all hope of escaping the mansion. Looking over at Jessica who was still worse than him.
</p>

<p>
"No" Mark said, standing up lifting Jessica up with him "Come on! We can find a back exit, then go around the mansion!"
Mark says practically dragging Jessica along with him, who had lost the will to even stand
</p>

<p>
Mark walking through the long hallways of the mansion, using his phone for a flashlight, he could loud screeching coming from all corners of the mansion.
It didn't help that he was practically pulling Jessica along with him, who wasn't in top form.
</p>

<p>
Mark stops, turning to face Jessica "We need to hurry Jessica! Those things will be back if we don't hurry and get out of here!" Mark shouts, echoing throughout the entire hallway
</p>

<p>
Jessica nods, continuing to walk alongside Mark, life beginning to return to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The storm continuing to hit the mansion, showing no sign of halting, Mark and Jessica continuing to press forward.
</p>

<p>
"There's a door leading outside!" Mark shouts, looking towards Jessica, completely missing the tall, grotesque monster blocking their exit, it hadn't noticed them
</p>

<p>
Mark notices almost right after, pulling Jessica behind a wall, hiding from the monster, which luckily did not see them.
</p>

<p>
"Fuck" Mark whispers as he holds Jessica close to him, covering her mouth so she couldn't scream
</p>
