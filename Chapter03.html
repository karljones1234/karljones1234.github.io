<h1>Chapter 3: There will be Blood</h1>

<p>
Mark crouched down at the door, which had been blocked by a collapsed tree outside, shock and terror was finally starting to get through the cracks in Mark's armor.
Given up on all hope of escaping the mansion. Looking over at Jessica who was still worse than him.
</p>

<p>
"No" Mark said, standing up lifting Jessica up with him "Come on! We can find a back exit, then go around the mansion!"
Mark says practically dragging Jessica along with him, who had lost the will to even stand
</p>

<p>
Mark walking through the long hallways of the mansion, using his phone for a flashlight, he could loud screeching coming from all corners of the mansion.
It didn't help that he was practically pulling Jessica along with him, who wasn't in top form.
</p>

<p>
Mark stops, turning to face Jessica "We need to hurry Jessica! Those things will be back if we don't hurry and get out of here!" Mark shouts, echoing throughout the entire hallway
</p>

<p>
Jessica nods, continuing to walk alongside Mark, life beginning to return to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The storm continuing to hit the mansion, showing no sign of halting, Mark and Jessica continuing to press forward.
</p>

<p>
"There's a door leading outside!" Mark shouts, looking towards Jessica, completely missing the tall, grotesque monster blocking their exit, it hadn't noticed them
</p>

<p>
Mark notices almost right after, pulling Jessica behind a wall, hiding from the monster, which luckily did not see them.
</p>

<p>
"Fuck" Mark whispers as he holds Jessica close to him, covering her mouth so she couldn't scream
</p>

<p>
"we have to sneak past time somehow" Mark whispers, starting to slowly walk outside towards the exit, the freakishly tall monster lurking around the area.
Mark unaware to the fact that the monster had no vision, their actions were based off of smell and sound.
</p>

<p>
Mark stopping in his tracks, his eyes widened as the monster turns to look in his direction, Mark frozen in place as he looked at the monster in the face,
sweat dripping from his brow as he gulps.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't it see m-" Mark couldn't finish his sentence, before long Jessica had screamed at the top of her lungs as she noticed the monster,
up until now her eyes had been shut, tugging along with Mark as he had led the way, her decision to open her eyes at that moment would cost them their lives.
</p>
  
<p>
The monster forcing it's large pale claws through Mark's chest, blood spewing from his mouth and the gaping hole that was in his chest
</p>
  
<p>
As Mark's lifeless body falls to the floor Jessica let's out a horrific scream, just before her head was removed from her body in one swift motion
</p>
  
<p>
Their bodies slowly being devoured, it was the end of the night, it was a bloody night, with no one to tell the story, that monsters do exist.
</p>
