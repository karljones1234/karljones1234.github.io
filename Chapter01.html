<h1>Chapter 1: The Abandoned Mansion</h1>
<p>The winds howled and echoed against the windows of the mansion, the rain hitting the roof loudly,
the tree branches scraping off the side of the abandoned mansion. The night was horrible, and felt endless,
stranded and alone a group of teenagers make their way to the mansion.
"This way! We'll take shelter here" a boy shouted as he pushed the branches out of the way,
rushing to the door to take shelter from the rain, unaware of the horrors that awaited them.
</p>

<p>
The teenagers one by one rushed into the abandoned mansion, sitting at the steps of the front hall,
admiring the huge room that they had happened to find themselves in. Minutes pass in complete silence, the girls drying their hair from the rain,
the guys sitting at the large staircase that was situated right at the entrance of the mansion, a boy stands up and points towards group of girls.
</p>
<p>
"This is all Jessicas fault!" the boy shouted, his gaze set upon Jessica, the eldest girl who was 17 years old, long blonde hair and blue eyes,
</p>
<p>
Jessica stops drying her hair and retaliates against the boy. "Mark, need I remind you that it was you and Johns idea to go out tonight!"
Jessica shouted at the two boys.
</p>
<p>
John pushes Mark aside and looks at the two girls "Why are we fighting? Sarah, let's explore the mansion a bit, it's huge."
John says looking towards Sarah.
</p>
Sarah nods and walks with John, entering one of the large rooms of the mansion, leaving Mark and John alone in the main room.
