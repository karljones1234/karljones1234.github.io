<h1>Chapter 1: The Mansion at the top of the hill</h1>
<p>The winds howled and echoed against the windows of the mansion at the top of the hill, the rain hitting the roof loudly,
the tree branches scraping off the side of the abandoned mansion. The night felt like it was endless,
stranded and alone a group of teenagers make their way to the mansion.
"This way! We'll take shelter here" a boy shouted as he pushed the branches out of the way,
rushing to the door to take shelter from the rain, unaware of the horrors that awaited them.

<p>
The teenagers one by one rushed into the abandoned mansion, sitting at the steps of the front hall,
admiring the huge room that they had happened to find themselves in.
