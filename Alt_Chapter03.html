<h1>Chapter 3: There will be Blood</h1>

<p>
Mark crouched down at the door, which had been blocked by a collapsed tree outside, shock and terror was finally starting to get through the cracks in Mark's armor.
Given up on all hope of escaping the mansion. Looking over at Jessica who was still worse than him.
</p>

<p>
"No" Mark said, standing up lifting Jessica up with him "Come on! We can find a back exit, then go around the mansion!"
Mark says practically dragging Jessica along with him, who had lost the will to even stand
</p>

<p>
Mark walking through the long hallways of the mansion, using his phone for a flashlight, he could loud screeching coming from all corners of the mansion.
It didn't help that he was practically pulling Jessica along with him, who wasn't in top form.
</p>

<p>
Mark stops, turning to face Jessica "We need to hurry Jessica! Those things will be back if we don't hurry and get out of here!" Mark shouts, echoing throughout the entire hallway
</p>

<p>
Jessica nods, continuing to walk alongside Mark, life beginning to return to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The storm continuing to hit the mansion, showing no sign of halting, Mark and Jessica continuing to press forward.
</p>

<p>
"There's a door leading outside!" Mark shouts, looking towards Jessica, completely missing the tall, grotesque monster blocking their exit, it hadn't noticed them
</p>

<p>
Mark notices almost right after, pulling Jessica behind a wall, hiding from the monster, which luckily did not see them.
</p>

<p>
"Fuck" Mark whispers as he holds Jessica close to him, covering her mouth so she couldn't scream
</p>

<p>
"we have to sneak past them somehow" Mark whispers, starting to slowly walk outside towards the exit, the freakishly tall monster lurking around the area.
Mark unaware to the fact that the monster had no vision, their actions were based off of smell and sound.
</p>

<!----------Alternative ending beyond this point ------------->
<p>
The monster slowly walking in a set pattern around the door, it's head hanging towards the floor, it's freakishly long arms trailling along with it.
The monster had no vision, no way of actually seeing it's prey, Mark had no idea of this fact.
</p>

<p>
Mark stopping in his tracks as the monster looked in their direction, frozen in place, it hadn't noticed him or Jessica, Mark could only wonder why? It was looking right at them.
Mark snapping out of it instantly, looking at Jessica who hadn't opened her eyes, thoughts flowing through his mind "if Jessica see's this she'll scream" Mark thought to himself.
</p>

<p>
Mark turns to face Jessica, her eyes still closed "Keep your eyes closed, don't open them" Mark whispers as he looks towards the monster, Mark desperately trying to understand everything,
whilst he wrestled the fear that lied within him.
</p>

<p>
Mark had realized that the monster could not see with sight, the only conclusion was sound and smell, which explained Sarah getting killed as she screamed over John.
</p>

<p>
Mark wallks Jessica over to underneath a large staircase, slowly walking as to not alert the monster which was still searching for them
</p>

<p>
"Stay here Jessica, I'll be back soon" Jessica nods in agreement, her eyes still shut as Mark slowly moves around to corner to observe the monster.
