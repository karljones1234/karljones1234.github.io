<h1>Chapter 4: The sun rises</h1>

<p>
Mark noticing that the monster could not see them, looking towards Jessica, who had her eyes closed the entire time
</p>

<p>
Mark turning to face Jessica, his hands placed firmly on her shoulders, her eyes still shut tight, refusing to open them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't open your eyes Jessica, keep them shut" Mark said, trying to keep her alive, as well as himself, he had only thought
if she opened her eyes and saw the massive monster in front of them she would scream, the only outcome from that would both of them dying.
</p>

<p>
Mark slowly moving towards the monster, slowly bringing Jessica along with him. The only way the monster could see them was by sound, or smell,
this was the answer Mark had come to.
</p>

<p>
Jessica had only opened her eyes for a second, to see a large pale monster standing in front of them, her eyes widened at the sight of it.
Her mouth opening as she releases a loud scream
</p>

<p>
"AHHHH" Jessica letting out a loud scream, the monster turning it's head instantly to stare at the screaming Jessica, who was staring at the monster, beginning to cry.
</p>

<p>
Mark releasing Jessica's arm, running away for his life, looking back at the monster, who had swiftly removed Jessicas head from her body, her lifeless body collapsing onto the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Fuck!.....Fuck!! FUCK" Mark began to shout as he continued to run, stopping in his tracks as he arrives back where he had started, back at the door which had been blocked by a collapsed tree
</p>


<p>
Mark collapsing onto his knees in front of the blocked door, tears filling his eyes as he realizes that everyone was dead, sweat had escaped to surface all over his body.
</p>

<p>
His panting breathing as he knelt there on the floor, unable to move as the monster came ever closer to him, swiftly killing him in one quick motion.
The monster holding his heart in it's hand, as Marks eyes darken, and his entire body hits the floor.
</p>

<p>
The sun rises on a horrible night, a night no one could witness, no stories would reveal the truth, that monsters really do exist
</p>
