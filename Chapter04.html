<p>
Mark noticing that the monster could not see them, looking towards Jessica, who had her eyes closed the entire time
</p>

<p>
Mark turning to face Jessica, his hands placed firmly on her shoulders, her eyes still shut tight, refusing to open them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't open your eyes Jessica, keep them shut" Mark said, trying to keep her alive, as well as himself, he had only thought
if she opened her eyes and saw the massive monster in front of them she would scream, the only outcome from that would both of them dying.
</p>

<p>
Mark slowly moving towards the monster, slowly bringing Jessica along with him. The only way the monster could see them was by sound, or smell,
this was the answer Mark had come to.
</p>

<p>
Jessica had only opened her eyes for a second, to see a large pale monster standing in front of them, her eyes widened at the sight of it.
Her mouth opening as she releases a loud scream
